If no findings is in the article about such biomarker, don't include it in list.\nFor each such biomarker extract name, type, description, notes and findings.\nFor findings, put the findings about the biomarker that are either result or discussed in the article.\nFor description, put general description of the biomarker, that description do not need to be in the article but should be descriptive.\nFor notes, put general notes about biomarker that are explicitly noted in the article besides findings. \nFor each finding generate a formal knowledge triplet separated to \"subject\",\"predicate\",\"object\" where \"subject\" is biomarker, \"predicate\" is verb from finding and \"object\" is an object from the finding.\nIf there is no knowledge in the article, generate single generic knowledge that relates to colorectal cancer and leave in the notes that it is generic knowledge only.\nReturn the response in strict JSON format with the following structure:\n\n[\n  { \"name\": \"biomarker name\",\"type\":\"biomarker type\",\"description\":\"biomarker description\",\"findings\":\"brief findings about biomarker in article as one sentence\",\"notes\":\"additional notes important to biomarker or empty string\", \"knowledge\":[{\"subject\":\"repeated biomarker name\",\"predicate\":\"some predicate from findings of biomarker\",\"object\":\"object that relates via predicate to the biomarker\" }],\n  { \"name\": \"biomarker2 name\",\"type\":\"biomarker2 type\",\"description\":\"biomarker2 description\",\"findings\":\"brief findings about biomarker2 in article as one sentence\",\"notes\":\"additional notes important to biomarker2 or empty string\", \"knowledge\":[{\"subject\":\"repeated biomarker2 name\",\"predicate\":\"some predicate from findings of  biomarker2\",\"object\":\"object that relates via predicate to the biomarker2\" }] }\n] \n\nEnsure there is no additional explanation, only return valid JSON.\n"
